# 2021-06-11 Meeting with Laura (ALICE, Finnish group)

Skip the videos, more interactive “searching around” - guides shifts the activity to run around in person
2 guides: one experimentalist and one theorist, but could also shorten to 30’ 
Guide steps in if time limit is reached 
Thinking of parallel tasks, 2 tasks at a time then collaborate
Large variety of audience (> 13 year old) 

## Games: 

Crosswords with numbers to be combined
Wooden puzzle
What is a proton
Equation game more ALICE themed

## Other games:

Think of computer task? Problem is not collaborative
Phone app - think of easy game generator? Problem is that they start using the phone on their own. Put one calculator in the room, need to work together. 

Edited to “there is a problem” rather than beam lost
Make more cohesive videos (mix of experiments right now)

Trigger video: just have a “this is the trigger system” and explain that


## Advice:

Phone call to the players “you are our only hope” to set the scene for the problem

Have engineer role that you need to communicate with to give you a key to continue in the quest - could incorporate international aspect by having the guide only communicate in English

Group size major factor
Room ventilation if big room (some time between the games to do this)

Allow for a trial period without changes 

Gather feedback: hand out a paper form and then they fill it. But maybe faster to have ipad.  

Approximately 2 people to run this: engineer, two guides, one director

Accessible for other universities: 
Don’t give out the solutions

Lanyards and helmets: need to be picked up at CERN
